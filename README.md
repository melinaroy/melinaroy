# 👋 Hi, I'm Mélina

I enjoy building useful tools with clean, maintainable, and scalable code — always with the end user in mind.

With a background in product management and studies in biomedical engineering, I care about building tech that brings real value, especially in healthcare, 3D, gaming and finance. As a developer with a hybrid mindset, I bring structure, product thinking, and a constant focus on usability and quality.

## 🧠 What I’m exploring

- Web development (JavaScript, Python, frontend/backend foundations)
- Clean architecture and good practices for maintainable code
- Upcoming projects: C++ and machine learning fundamentals
- Personal tools for daily life (especially finance-related)

## 🔨 Projects

- [propdf](https://github.com/melinaroy/propdf): my first real-world app — a PDF editor with GUI, now being refactored to improve structure and maintainability
- [university-course-planner](https://github.com/melinaroy/university-course-planner): JavaScript-based tool to plan courses at Université Laval
- [melina-learning](https://github.com/melina-learning): separate org where I store learning projects and university and online courses

## 📚 Notes & References

I organize notes, cheat sheets, project ideas, and personal references in this central repo. Most of it is for personal use, but it might be helpful to others too.<br>
