## Introduction

## 1. Begin with Data Structures

- Data structures are containers
- helps us connect and group our data
- data needs to be accessed in an efficient
- python built-in data structures
  - lists: collection of items in a specific order
  - tuples: stores related data, similarto a list but immutable
  - dicts: unordered data, store key-value pairs; key retrieves the value
  - sets: store a collection of unique items in an unordered manner
    - {'dog', 'cat', 'fish'}
  - deck or deques: to insert or remove data from both ends, often used for queues and stacks
- how to choose the best data structure?
  - big O notation
    - describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm independently of input
    - the algorithm's worst case performance
    - each operation (insert, update, search) has its own time complexity
    - O(1) Constant time complexity: doesn't depend on the size of the input
    - O(n) Linear time complexity: grows linearly with the size of the input
    - O(n^2) Quadratic time complexity: proportional to the square of the items

## 2. Arrays

An array is a collection of elements where each item is identified by an index or key.

## 3. Dictionaries

a disctionnary is a data structure that holds key-value pairs.

- fast searching operations, but take up more space

## 4. sets

A set is a collection of unique items; unordered, no duplicate elements.

- abstract data type
- check for compatibility
- same idea as dictionaries, but keys are the values
